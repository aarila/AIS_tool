# AIS_tool
Tool for drawing time-series combining AIS data and wave models to study the wave conditions along ferry routes in the Baltic Sea.

Edits to make the tool faster and added +-1 SD to the time-series


The tool uses AIS data for vessel positions and wave data which is based on the operational BALMFC wave model WAM run by FMI (Tuomi et al. 2017). It has a spatial resolution of 1 nmi and is forced with the HARMONIE wind forcing.
